# MongoDB GenAI Developer Day Notebooks

This repository contains my **personal working copies** of the Jupyter Notebooks for MongoDB's GenAI Developer Day.  
I am actively going through the labs, experimenting with the exercises, and making modifications in my own environment.

The original, self-paced workshops are available at:

* [Vector Search: Beginner to Pro](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/vector-search-lab/)
* [Building RAG Applications with MongoDB](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/ai-rag-lab/)
* [The A to Z of Building AI Agents](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/ai-agents-lab/)

## Notes

- This repository is based on the original MongoDB Developer Day notebooks but is maintained independently.  
- Changes I make locally may differ from the original content as I experiment with code, dependencies, and configurations.  
- For reproducibility, I’m using `uv` to manage the Python environment and dependencies.
