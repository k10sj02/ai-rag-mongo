# MongoDB GenAI Developer Day Notebooks

This repository contains my **personal working copies** of the Jupyter Notebooks for MongoDB's GenAI Developer Day.  
I am actively going through the labs, experimenting with the exercises, and making modifications in my own environment.

The original, self-paced workshops are available at:

* [Vector Search: Beginner to Pro](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/vector-search-lab/)
* [Building RAG Applications with MongoDB](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/ai-rag-lab/)
* [The A to Z of Building AI Agents](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/ai-agents-lab/)

## Updating from the Original Repository

To keep this repository in sync with the original MongoDB GenAI notebooks, use the following workflow:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
